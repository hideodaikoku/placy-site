  "about_mission": "We sometimes feel vaguely that our city is boring.\n\nThe scenery has become homogenised everywhere you go.\n\nAt the risk of sounding pretentious, we see the cause as being that the space and meaning layers are disconnected.\n\nNo matter how appealing the space, if it is disconnected from its meaning in its virtual presence, people will judge it by oversimplified list-based perspectives such as reviews and rankings.\n\nWith that in mind, we are developing a map to help you find places based on music.\n\nWe provide users the experience of finding places based on their instinct, not on faked or homogenised metrics.\n\nIn the near future, we will add movies books and other mediums. So you enter your preferences and we translate that accross to places that you may like.\n\nOur mission is to connect space to its meaning.",
  "about_explanation": "Every city has its \"rhythm\" Rich culture and millions of stories over the ages have become ingrained in the fabric of the city, echoing out its “rhythm”.\n\nIt is what makes the city beautiful and lovable. Sometimes, when you exploring a city, you are drawn to a place, as magnets are drawn to each other; proof that your inner “rhythm” resonates with the city's rhythm.\n\nWhether it be a shiny and extravagant part of town, or a the gloomy yet human neighborhood, there is a place that matches your rhythm, out there waiting for you to find.\n\nForget the reviews. Follow your rhythm.",
