Reinterpretation of Urban Public Spaces after COVID-19 : Experiences from Ankara/Turkey
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start by mentioning the despair of the modern men when they lock themselves in the house. They are the epitome of the ones who prefer spending many hours of the day ‘’locking themselves’’, being glued to their mobile phones and thus, changing the common understanding of ‘’socialization’’ to a large extent compared to the last decade. If I narrow the scale of my expressions and extend my lens to a more specific issue, I would like to share some impressions from the Turkish society. While transferring these impressions, I will focus on the new perception of our social life, coexistence, agglomeration culture and the new perception of public spaces with frequent references to this extraordinary pandemic process. Because, as it is mentioned in the heading, I think that urban public spaces have been reinterpreted especially in the city where I live. Moreover, this re-interpretation is not just a design or form oriented process; it is a process that rearranges life practices, social relations and urban culture. In short, it reconstructs the dialectical relationship between the space and people.

On the morning of March 11, the Minister of Health announced the first COVID-19 case in Turkey with a press conference. That was the day when the General Director of World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Following that, the measures and mechanisms to combat the pandemic and the decisions that have influenced the urban life as a whole have accelerated. Now, allow me to timestamp some of the crucial decisions concerning the utilization of urban public spaces and daily life routines according to signposts stated during COVID-19.

Obviously, there were substantial number of scenarios that have already experienced by other countries. Although most of these experiences did not affect the results positively, ‘’ what shouldn’t be done’’ was very clear for Turkish society. When the **timeline** is examined, successive and rather rapid decisions correspond to the periods when the cases or weekly mortality rates were significantly increased. As of June 1, we’ve initiated a rapid ‘’normalization process’’ and will see the effects of this process in the coming 15 or 20-day period. This normalization process marks an extensive new order; refering the opening some educational institutions, bringing cafes and restaurants into service and removing most of the restrictions gradually on travel and curfew. As a result of my observations, that I’ve tried to make objectively, I can say that urban decision-making mechanisms -that works faster compared to the European countries- has resulted in Turkey’s favor, at least in some specific scenarios. On the other hand, due to the lately declared curfews and sudden changes of decision, it was not possible to prevent the citizens from being together in a pile. If we consider the distance rules, as an example, especially in open public spaces, it is easy to see that they are not taken into account by the urban residents who are the permanent users of the space. Such rules being tried to be implemented only with a design focus (such as single-seater benches, distance lines applied to urban parks and gardens and general regulations in areas with high pedestrian circulation) are quite weak attempts to create a new perception for the use of urban public spaces in my estimation.

The scenarios for our ‘new normal’ continue to be developed and made more meaningful all over the world. Nevertheless, my individual experience and observation show me that **the decision-making and implementation processes are managed by the local residents; not the governments** and the best places to observe this situation are public spaces. It is hard to predict what kind of design practices, spatial arrangements or social rules will be implemented in the future. One thing is certain: The societies that shape their own space culture and spatial perception will continue to do so in the post-quarantine period.

**All in all, as we commonly say ‘’There are just a few things new about the _new normal._’’**
