Participatory design and more social infrastructure: London should start its post-pandemic transformation by listening to its communities.

Every Thursday at 8pm, in a practice repeated up and down the country, the residents of my London housing estate stop what they are doing and emerge onto their balconies to clap, whistle and bang pans in tribute to the UK’s health workers. Our applause, which echoes off the snaking concrete ziggurats of the modernist mid-rise, is a gesture of thanks for the great burden that doctors, nurses, hospital porters and cleaners are bearing. There is some irony in being quarantined here. Modernism, which imagined cities as functional and clean, seems starkly at odds with the disorder and contagion of a pandemic. And yet the response of my neighbours has been an antidote for the times. Watching a community organise itself to remedy the shortfalls in local services has shown a way forward for living with covid-19.

Unsurprisingly for a city of nearly nine million people, London has been the epicentre of the pandemic in the UK. At the time of writing we have had over 25,000 confirmed cases and more than a sixth of the nation’s 30,000 fatalities. And with the UK now leading Europe for Coronavirus-related deaths, the government’s response has been severely called into question.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson first introduced measures to curb civil liberties on March 23 with the announcement of a formal quarantine, accompanied by the slogan ‘Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives’. What followed was six weeks of government-mandated social distancing. Britons were allowed to leave their residences only for essential supplies and one session of physical exercise a day. All the while the Prime Minister, his Secretary for Health and the country’s Chief Medical Officer — all of whom would contract covid-19 themselves — missed their self-imposed testing targets and had to deal with mounting public anger as stories emerged of various lapses in the country’s preparations.

In early May, Johnson announced a new roadmap for ending the nationwide lockdown, forecasting a phased reopening of society over the course of the next two months. With this announcement came the new slogan ‘Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives’. The updated version met with widespread criticism for its lack of clarity. ‘Stay Alert’ fails as a message where ‘Stay at Home’ succeeded because it lacks the spatial imperative of its predecessor. _How_ and, more importantly, _where,_ is one meant to stay alert? In a city like London, with its rich and varied public life, this vagueness threatens a return to dense social gatherings at a time when our recovery is still very much in the balance. Already, as we enter a warm late spring, and with the summer months looming, parks and public spaces have become noticeably busier. Londoners, it seems, are already emerging from their hibernation.

Pandemics are anti-urban at root. Proximity between people is both the fundamental characteristic of city life and the life force of communicable disease. But cities have endured in spite of long histories of plague, infection and cataclysm — events where their density puts them at a grave disadvantage. Citizens have, whether knowingly or not, accepted those risks as part of their lives. The Harvard economist Edward Glaeser estimates that the denizens of 16th century London could expect to live on average six years less than those in other parts of the country. Likewise we now accept pollution, overcrowding and the threat of terror as an acceptable price for more economic opportunity, a rich public life and a greater range of amenities. This is the lot of every city dweller: the threat of urban ills are offset by the myriad ‘agglomeration benefits’ that density bestows.

But no city is designed or experienced equally, and pandemics are liable to hit the most vulnerable communities disproportionately hard. Since 2010, successive UK governments have cut local government funding sharply, with severe consequences. In London, the highest rates of covid-19 deaths per 100,000 residents have overwhelmingly come from the city’s poorest and most densely-populated boroughs, where cuts to services have been most keenly felt. Equally damning, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups have been demonstrably over-represented at every point of the clinical pathway, recording higher numbers of hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit referrals and deaths. Covid-19 has cast a light on London’s gross imbalances, with spatial inequality and health inequality marching hand in hand. In this time of crisis, place matters more than ever.

All of which lays bare the cruel paradox of the pandemic: we are expected to remain distant at a time when people most require the support of others. In his 2018 book _Palaces of the People_, American sociologist Eric Klinenberg argues emphatically for the value of social infrastructure — the public amenities and taken-for-granted systems that support collective life. His wide-ranging study of libraries, green spaces, community groups and the like all points to an inescapable fact: those neighbourhoods with more social infrastructure fare better in times of crisis than those with less. It is clear that, as in all cities, London will now need to restructure its physical environment to the reduce risk to its citizens. One of first questions we should be asking in response is how can we provide social infrastructure in a time of social distancing?

Local authorities will be integral in taking up the challenge. They can begin by putting the needs of their residents front and centre, widening access to design through community-led forums and adding more infection-safe infrastructures like green spaces, cycling and walking routes. These measures have the dual benefit of addressing public health issues while promoting community connectivity and resilience. But with London’s councils now facing large shortfalls in their budgets and with local services already stretched to breaking point, the process will take time. In the meantime, much will be incumbent on communities organising themselves as they have on my housing estate, where a kind of DIY urbanism has sprung up to cover the gaps in state provision. Prompted by WhatsApp communications and noticeboard flyers, residents have mobilised to organise litter collection, draw two-metre markings on the pavements and tend to the local park. These stop-gap solutions have shown the power of local action when it is given the conditions to thrive.

So as London moves beyond the initial shock response and towards its medium-term future living with covid-19, it is imperative that our local authorities do all they can to nurture the collective potential of their communities. Public health is in part a spatial question, and one that can be answered by working with those at the sharp end. The pandemic has thrown the city’s inequalities into stark relief, but local authorities can redress some of the worst imbalances by actively promoting a community’s participation in design and adding to its social infrastructure. These responses have the power to transform some of London’s most deprived pockets, all the while increasing the city’s resilience as a whole to future catastrophes.
