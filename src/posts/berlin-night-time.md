Berlin’s Kontaktbeschränkungen and the Night Time Culture Shift
===============================================================

Social culture is a key part of the lives we lead, and the night is a particularly unique condition in which we socialise: feelings of excitement, fear, romance, and fun are built into our shared and individual experiences of the night. Nightlife comprises a particularly large part of Berlin’s culture, and provides a critical part of what makes the city vibrant: as *Monocle Magazine’s* The Urbanist puts it “the night time is about keeping us alive.”

It is undeniable that the club scene, in particular the queer club scene (including the infamous sex clubs and parties) are [fundamental aspects of Berlin’s culture](https://www.clubcommission.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/club-culture-study.pdf) to many people: the attitude of open-mindedness, willingness to explore, and ability to physically experiment are part of what draws them to the city in the first place. Not only that, but the clubs are a critical part of Berlin’s economy, to the tune of [€1.5 billion](https://www.clubcommission.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/club-culture-study.pdf). As a result, the impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on Berlin’s nightlife could be huge, both culturally and economically.

_Quarantine “Kontaktbeschränkungen”_

Berlin, and Germany more broadly, has tackled COVID-19 by implementing a *Kontaktbeschränkungen* (contact restriction) rather than a curfew. The Mayors from Berlin and Brandenburg [called for](https://www.berlin.de/en/news/coronavirus/6112350-6098215-avoid-curfew-berlin-and-brandenburg-call.en.html) “personal responsibility” in limiting social contacts, rather than imposing a limitation on leaving homes or apartments completely.

This means that during the entire COVID-19 response you could go out for a run, ride your bike with your family, or easily get takeaway coffee or pizza. You could even go for a walk with a friend, and have a social-distancing beer in the park. But you can’t *touch* anyone, regardless of what other hygiene measures you take. In late May, the _Kontaktbeschränkungen_ is still in place, and requires that you must keep 1.5m away from all other people at all times. If you break this rule, you can be fined up to €500. Through March, April, and early May, if you visited somebody else in their home the fine was up to €1000 for the visitor, and €2500 for the host.

In Berlin’s culture of clubbing and nightlife, the freedom to engage with and be physical with others is *why they come here*, and a large sector of the population in Berlin lives a lifestyle that heavily revolves around these kind of social activities. In the context of larger public health issues (and significant numbers of deaths and illnesses worldwide) clubs and nightlife are rightfully a low priority, and with such a large outbreak in Germany they should remain closed. However, when the night time economy forms such a large part of a city’s culture, long-term physical distancing rules (including extended club and bar shutdowns) may have significant consequences in the post-pandemic city, both for the economy and social behaviour. That is not to say that people should not follow the *Kontaktbeschränkungen*: they should, as not following the rules can have major impacts for public health on a much greater scale than any one individual’s hunger for contact. But when a physical and social institution is such a large part of the culture of a city, the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions may affect cultural and social interactions long after restrictions are lifted.

_Club Shutdowns_

The Berlin clubs shut down on Friday, March 13th, with the most infamous of them all, Berghain, one of the first to close its doors. Music shifted online, to the [unitedwestream.berlin](https://unitedwestream.berlin/) platform, which provided musicians and DJs an opportunity to perform sets, with the aim of saving the club scene through listener donations. Some clubs also started [crowdfunding](https://www.startnext.com/renate-needs-help-nothing-else) platforms, to raise money so that they won’t go under.

Initial predictions were far off the mark: the first news from Berghain was that “doors would remain closed at least until 20 April.” Even as cases slowly decline in Berlin, the Senate has said nothing about the reopening of clubs. Restaurants were allowed to open until 10pm from 15 May, with the *Kontaktbeschränkungen* remaining in place. Clubs will no-doubt be one of the last things in the city to be considered, particularly given that several of the first virus clusters in Berlin [began in two clubs](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/2020/coronavirus/beitraege/corona-infektionen-berliner-clubs-kalayci.html): the Trompete and Kater Blau.

Despite this understandable hesitance, the importance of nightlife should not be underestimated. In the past few years many [cities around Europe](https://theconversation.com/nightlife-is-the-soul-of-cities-and-night-mayors-are-its-keepers-in-this-coronavirus-pandemic-134327) have appointed “Night Mayors”, specifically to manage the interface between nightlife, public spaces, and the people who make use of those spaces. The benefits of nightlife and the night time economy were [discussed on The Urbanist podcast](https://monocle.com/radio/shows/the-urbanist/446/) from *Monocle Magazine*, with Mirik Milan, the former Night Mayor of Amsterdam. Milan has already partnered up with Berlin’s Club Commissioner “to produce a global nighttime recovery plan”, but he notes one major issue: “a dance floor is the most fun when it’s crowded. … you can’t run at 30% capacity.” What’s more is that “you also have your employees of course. Do they want to come to work? … How do you keep them safe?”

These spaces are important because they are a part of social interaction more broadly: nightlife is “where we connect, this is where we innovate … cross-pollination happens at night.” Milan also notes the acuteness of the crisis for the queer community in particular, explaining that “this crisis is also being approached from a centre that everybody has a family to fall back on when you are in isolation or when you are in quarantine … there are so many [queer] singles … [who] really rely on going out for socialising … it’s also for your mental health, very important.”

The question of coping [has already been asked](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/z3bawy/berghain-is-closed-so-what-are-berlins-club-goers-doing) in Vice: “how do a group of people whose lives revolve around the physically intimate and mentally liberating world of almost non-stop clubbing deal with being told to stay indoors in tiny apartments?”. The answer is “it varies”. Some people are being careful; others are ignoring the contact restrictions and hosting parties from their apartments, despite the potentially serious consequences.

In those cases, “people have [said] they later feel regretful about risking their health and the health of others.” In fact, a survey of LGBTQ+ club-goers in Berlin showed that the vast majority of people believe that the club shutdown was the correct action for the city of Berlin to have taken, and another large majority (nearly 85%) are afraid of either catching the virus, or giving it to someone else.

This glimpse of fear gives a clue that we should be moving beyond the question of “How are people coping now?” and examining the potential shift in “How will people behave after?”. For those surveyed, people were pretty evenly split between wanting to return to the clubs straight away, or taking some time to wait and see whether it’s safe or not. For those who do return, most people planned to either keep their behaviour “the same as before”, or to have physical contact with fewer people. Around 20% were not sure how they would behave, and 8% planned to have more physical contact.

These responses indicate that even in the touch-heavy LGBTQ+ Berlin party scene, most people are not planning to go wildly hedonistic: rather, they simply hope for things to be like they used to be, proceeding with caution. It will undoubtedly be a long time before club culture comes back to the city, and it’s hard to imagine what a party looks like here without the freedom of touch. Daniel Kahneman, author of the book *Thinking Fast and Slow* [noted](https://monocle.com/radio/shows/the-urbanist/446/) that “there is going to be lingering fear of other people. … So when you think of whole industries that really survive by cramming people together… that is going to be interesting, whether people remain, and whether fear lingers. … It’s a matter not of weeks, not months, but of years.”

_Post-Quarantine Club Culture: How Can Cities Preserve Their Nightlife?_

Nightlife more generally will need to adjust to a new normal, and the appointment of Night Mayors such as in Amsterdam, [Berlin](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/pilotprojekt-in-schoeneberg-der-regenbogenkiez-bekommt-einen-nachtbuergermeister/25570578.html), and other cities may be a step in the right direction. Other potential ideas have included [PPE rave suits](https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/49102/1/ppe-rave-suit-designed-safely-socialise-club-production-club-coronavirus?fbclid=IwAR21E-7szz03ciBdtcziIh-xCCfZJ60wTLyfhqa6WZUvmKuYyrwehW1umhI) (unlikely), or as some survey respondents suggested, better hand-washing facilities in clubs, a mask requirement for all club-goers, or limited numbers of people being allowed in. In China, clubs are [slowly reopening](https://www.electronicbeats.net/post-lockdown-club-scene-shanghai-shenzhen-hangzhou-china/) and have found that numbers are lower than usual anyway, that some people wear masks, and that people tend to come earlier and leave earlier than before.

A [new outbreak in a queer club in Seoul](https://time.com/5836699/south-korea-coronavirus-lgbtq-itaewon/) has shown how just how difficult it will be to reopen clubs and bars, while still controlling the virus. With the large potential for a second wave of infection, club re-openings may be short-lived, and the presence of new outbreaks could then lead to an even greater fear of other people, including stigma and discrimination against those who spread the infection. Instead of coming together people may begin to take on a default distance, and an ongoing fear of closeness. One survey respondent was worried about what the shutdown means for the Berlin club community going forward, noting that the enforced club shutdown “will be a huge personality changer for many people, a drug retreat with the possibility for self-reflection.” But in the long term the sentiment is clear: “it will have negative consequences for the culture \[and the\] common vibe.”
